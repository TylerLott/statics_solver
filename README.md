# statics_solver
This app uses linear algebra to solve static systems in three dimensional space
- it is able to solve basic statically determinate systems that are generally in entry engineering courses

what I learned
- how to solve statically determinate systems with linear algebra techniques
- how to manipulate arrays and lists in python
- how to generate a list of instances of a class

what needs to be done
- create a gui
- create an effective way to determine if a force is on a member
- sum all the forces and moments acting on the end points of a member
- create a function to find the shear forces and bending moments in all planes on a member
- display the bending moment and shear forces graphically
- create bending moment releases and shear force releases

possible expansions past statics
- cross sectional area of members in order to find stresses and strains within members
